	<p>This page is displayed when there is no report created/generated yet.</p>
	<p>The report has been deleted by Website admin and still not created a new one.</p>
	<p>
		Deleting report is allowed by ARV to do self uninstall if its desired to do cleanup any ARV data before removing it.
		Its also good if its happen that any Public user could access report folder.
